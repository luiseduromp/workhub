# WorkHub - Job Board App

This is a simple job board application built with Next.js. It fetches job listings from [Jobicy API](https://github.com/Jobicy/remote-jobs-api) and displays it in a list.

The main page allows to filter results by tag, location and industry, which are the parameters provided by the API to filter the results.

Each job post has its own page, with the whole information and description.
